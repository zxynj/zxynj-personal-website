# Natural Disaster and Oil Refinenry Visualization


## Project description:

Visualize historical natural disasters and oil refineries in the United States on map.

## Approaches:

I first downloaded 60 years of natural disaster data from Federal Emergency Management Agency's [website](https://www.google.com/search?q=fema&oq=fema&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l4j35i39.1254j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). Then I scraped all crude oil refineries information from Global Energy Observatory's [website](http://globalenergyobservatory.org/list.php?db=Resources&type=Crude_Oil_Refineries). I filtered and cleaned up the data before import into Tableau. Finally, I visualized the data in Tableau.

## Results:
